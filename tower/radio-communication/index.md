HARDWARIO TOWER provides two main radio communication methods

## [**Sub-GHz Radio**](./sub-ghz-radio.md)

First is using our integrated **SPIRIT1 radio transceiver**, which can provide solid coverage of about **500 meters line-of-sight** and should be enough for a three-story building with a garden around it.

Every [**Core Module**](../hardware-modules/about-core-module.md) has this radio on it, so if you bought it, you will just need the [**Radio Dongle**](../hardware-modules/about-radio-dongle.md) and you can start your network

## [**LoRa WAN Radio**](./lora-wan-radio.md)

This solution requires [**LoRa Module**](../hardware-modules/about-lora-module.md) and a LoRa network available.

LoRa network provides a Low-Power solution for a wide area network. This means you can send messages over a long distance without draining your batteries.

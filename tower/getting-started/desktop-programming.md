We developed our tools to make it easier to start with TOWER.

If you just want to start using TOWER, connect devices to [**Radio Dongle**](../hardware-modules/about-radio-dongle.md), flash firmware to devices, analyze messages or do some basic visual programming with Node-RED, you can use HARDWARIO Playground.

The Playground is our desktop application for **all the major operating systems** that you can just **download** or **install** to your machine and use to manage TOWER devices.

:::tip

To learn more about HARDWARIO Playground, visit the [**Desktop Programming section**](../category/desktop-programming).

You might want to use TOWER for something like Smart Home or something similar.
For this, you will need a permanent solution that can run most of the time, independently and reliably.

We decided to use **Raspberry Pi** as a solution. It is a widely used, available and affordable mini pc that can simply be turned into a server that you need.

To make the process even easier we created a [**system image that can be simply flashed to a microSD**](../server-raspberry-pi/installation-os.md) card and used right away

If you have [**your Raspberry Pi**](../server-raspberry-pi/installation-clean-os.md) already installed and running, you can also just install all the needed tools.

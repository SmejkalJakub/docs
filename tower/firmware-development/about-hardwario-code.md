:::caution

If you experience some issues or difficulties with the extension or portable version, please let us know on [**our forum**](https://forum.hardwario.com/) or directly on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/hardwario/hardwario-tower-vscode-extension/issues).

:::

This chapter focuses on **HARDWARIO Code** which is our slightly changed version of [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com). It includes all needed tools that are needed to develop firmware for HARDWARIO TOWER.

:::note

If you already have your **Visual Studio Code** and don't want to install the new version, there is an extension available that you can install.

You will need to install all needed tools by yourself, on how to do that visit the [**TOWER VSCode Extension chapter**](./tower-vscode-extension.md).

We tried to make sure that the installation of Playground is as easy as possible so we created **Installation packages** for all the major operating systems.

## Download

To download Playground you can visit the [**Download Page**](https://www.hardwario.com/download/#), there is a link to the **latest version** of Playground and you will be offered downloads based on **your operating system**.

:::tip

If you want to download any other version or are interested in the application itself, you can visit the [**Playground GitHub repository**](https://github.com/hardwario/bch-playground/releases).

:::

:::note

There is always an **installation package** and also just an **executable option**. It is up to you which you choose to download, they should work the same.

## Installation

If you downloaded the **installation package** just run it and get through the installation and you should be ready to use Playground

If you downloaded just the **executable**, you can run it you should be ready to use Playground

You can now read about each tab of Playground, to understand what each of them does:
- [**Radio Network Management**](./radio-network-management.md) (**Devices** and **Messages**)
- [**Node-RED Programming**](./node-red-programming.md) (**Functions**)
- [**Data Visualization**](./data-visualization.md) (**Dashboard**)
- [**Firmware Flashing**](./firmware-flashing.md) (**Firmware**)

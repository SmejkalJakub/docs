In this chapter, we will go over the **Dashboard Tab** of Playground

:::info

The **Dashboard Tab** needs the Node-RED set up correctly to work. If you don't know how to do that please visit the [**Node-RED Programming chapter**](./node-red-programming.md).

## Dashboard Tab

On this tab, you can display **gauges**, **graphs**, **buttons** and **other widgets**. This can be used for home automation visualization and control.

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--8">
      <div><Image img={require('./dashboard-tab.png')}/></div>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--2">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

This chapter focuses on the **Firmware Tab** of Playground

## Firmware Tab

This tab allows you to **flash pre-compiled firmware** for all HARDWARIO projects from our [**GitHub**](https://github.com/orgs/hardwario/repositories).

A list of firmware is **downloaded automatically**.

**Choose the firmware** or start typing to find a project you like to try. You can also **flash binary or HEX files** from your computer.

:::tip

To flash firmware from the computer just use the **Three Dots** on the right side.

:::

After you choose the firmware, make sure that you have the **correct device selected**.

:::caution

If you are flashing **Radio Dongle** make sure that you have it **Disconnected** in the **Devices Tab**.

## Video Tutorial

If you prefer a video guide, you can watch this video for the older Playground version, but it works the same.

In this chapter, we will go over the **Functions Tab** of Playground

:::info

The **Functions Tab** uses the [**Node-RED**](https://nodered.org/about/) tool for working with TOWER and other devices.

We can't cover everything about this tool in this tutorial so if you want to learn more, you can visit the [**Node-RED documentation**](https://nodered.org/docs/).

## Functions Tab

You should see a screen that looks like this

<Image img={require('./playground-functions.png')}/>

### Nodes

On the left side of the screen, there is a list of nodes that you can use for multiple actions in the Node-RED programming.

:::info

There are a lot of nodes available for Node-RED that you can install but you should be able to work with TOWER devices just with the available preinstalled nodes.

:::

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--2">
      <div><Image img={require('./node-red-mqtt-node.png')}/></div>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--8">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<br />

You can use nodes for multiple functions. As an example, there is a **data visualization** that is tightly connected with the [**Dashboard Tab**](./data-visualization.md).

:::info

To learn more about Node-RED flows please visit [**our projects on hackster.io**](https://www.hackster.io/hardwario/projects?part_id=73696). Each project that uses Node-RED has a lot of information about how to work with it.

## Video Tutorial

If you prefer a video guide, you can watch this video for the older Playground version, but it works the same.

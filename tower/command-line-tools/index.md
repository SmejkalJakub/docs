We developed several **Command Line Tools** to make it possible to work with HARDWARIO TOWER even without GUI applications.

These tools can be used to:
- Run your server with all needed tools as discussed in the [**previous chapter**](../server-raspberry-pi/index.md)
- Develop your firmware without the use of any **advanced GUI tools**, more on that in the [**firmware development section**](../firmware-development/development-with-cli-tools.md)
- Store your **MQTT messages** to the **Influx database** with a **mqtt2influxdb** tool, you can read more in [**its chapter**](./mqtt-to-influx-db.md)


:::note

We have a lot of GUI tools as well, if you want to learn more about those, visit [**Desktop Programming Chapter**](../category/desktop-programming) or [**About HARDWARIO Code Chapter**](../firmware-development/about-hardwario-code.md)

A Serial Peripheral Bus (**SPI**) is a synchronous serial bus. It’s used for fast interconnection of the peripherals inside the device. TOWER uses SPI for example in the [**LCD Module**](../hardware-modules/about-lcd-module.md).

The SPI uses these signals:

- **SCK - Serial Clock (P14 Core Module)** - SPI transfers are synchronous and need the clock signal
- **MOSI - Master Out, Slave In (P13 Core Module)** - This is serial output **from MCU to the peripheral**
- **MISO - Master In, Slave Out (P12 Core Module)** - This is serial input for data **from peripheral to MCU**
- **NSS - Negative Slave Select (P15 Core Module)** - This signal activates the slave device. It’s **active low**, that’s why the word negative. If you have multiple slave devices you have **multiple NSS signals**. It’s sometimes also called the **Chip Select CS**.

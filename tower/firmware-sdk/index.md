import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';

This section talks about most of the **SDK modules** and how to use them.

:::info

This section tightly connects to the previous [**Firmware Development section**](../firmware-development/index.md) so if you skipped that it is advised to read it.

Two chapters talk about the ways you can approach the programming of your application:
- [**Event-Driven Programming**](./event-driven-programming.md)
- [**Task Scheduler**](./task-scheduler.md)

Next, there are the chapters that talk about the use of SDK modules and how to use them.

The [**LoRa Module**](../../hardware-modules/about-lora-module.md) provides a simple way how to connect your kit to the LoRA network. You can use commercial, community or your own LoRa gateway to receive messages from your device.

The most used community LoRa backends are [**The Things Network**](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org) and [**LorIoT**](https://www.loriot.io).
